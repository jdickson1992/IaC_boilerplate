## What does it do? 🔎
This repo will create a full `Infrastructure as Code` (IaC) environment, from **provisioning** to **deployment**, using:

- `Terraform` to provision resources on the cloud ☁️
- `Ansible` to setup infra on the cloud and initialise the **Docker Swarm** cluster 💻
- `Ansible` to deploy a docker stack on the cloud infra 🐳
     - The stack deployed will illustrate a 🔵🟢 deployment.

If it is ran **as is**, it will create the below in the `us-east-1` region:
- **3** manager nodes (`t3.micro` servers)
- **5** worker nodes (`t3.micro` servers)

> The number of instances and instance type can be changed by passing a **.tfvars** file to terraform or by updating the defaults found [here](https://github.com/jdickson1992/IaC_boilerplate/blob/main/terraform/variables.tf).

A series(2️⃣) of blog posts describes this repo in full...

If you're curious, head over to https://jdickson.dev/posts/iac/swarm_cluster/ 👀

## Prerequisites 🔐

-  `Ansible`   **>=2.8**
-  `Terraform` **>=0.12**
-  `aws cli`

Access to a cloud provider account (This has only been tested on **AWS**)

> ⚠️ You will need to get programmatic access keys from AWS which have permissions to configure infra using Terraform.
>
> Follow this [link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-sec-cred-types.html) to retreive an access key.

When the above step has been completed, configure the credentials and associate them with a profile:

```bash
aws configure --profile terraform
AWS Access Key ID [None]: <enter the access key>
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: <enter the secret key>
Default region name [None]: <us-east-1>
Default output format [None]: <None>
```

Then set the `AWS_PROFILE` to be active in your current shell.

```bash
export AWS_PROFILE=terraform
```

You should now have permissions to provision resources via terraform 🚀

## Getting Started 🎬

Clone the repo and cd into the directory:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:jdickson1992/IaC_boilerplate.git && cd IaC_boilerplate
```

Execute the bash script `./deploy.sh`:

This script will present you with 3 options **[Enter the number associated with the option]**

  1. **full_iac** *[recommended]*
     1. Will provision the cloud infra & initiate a docker swarm cluster.
     2. A simple docker stack should be deployed to confirm the cluster is operational

  2. **delete_swarm** 
     1. Forces all nodes to leave swarm


  3. **destroy_iac**
     1. Destroys all infra created via terraform.
     2. **Run this when finished testing**.
 
If you executed `deploy.sh` with option **1**, you would have just generated a fully provisioned IaC environment with a running Docker stack! 🎉

To get onto those machines (managers / workers) and check out the docker services, use the `test.pem` file generated by terraform.

For e.g.:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:jdickson1992/IaC_boilerplate.git && cd IaC_boilerplate

$ ./deploy.sh
 ... <provided option 1>
 
$ cd terraform

$ alias terraform_ssh="ssh -i test.pem $(terraform output swarm_manager_public_ip | tr -d '"')"

$ terraform_ssh docker service ls
ID             NAME              MODE         REPLICAS   IMAGE                          PORTS
iuib974nlhnd   swarm_blue-app    replicated   4/4        irishbandit/devblog:flask-v2   *:30001->8080/tcp
3j0zjxsaauhp   swarm_green-app   replicated   4/4        irishbandit/devblog:flask-v2   *:30000->8080/tcp
v1dw1ndduez9   swarm_nginx       replicated   1/1        nginx:stable-alpine            *:80->80/tcp

$ terraform_ssh
[james@docker-manager-0 ~]$

```

> **NOTE**: In the above, we make use of a terraform output to generate a custom ssh command. See this [blog](https://jdickson.dev/posts/iac/swarm_cluster_2/#what-did-we-deploy-there-) for more info


## Blue-green deployments 🔵🟢

The script `./switch_traffic.sh` can be used to illustrate how **traffic is switched** between the blue and green applications.

Under the covers this is just running a *docker service update* command, something akin to:

```
docker service update --env-add ACTIVE_BACKEND=green-app --env-add BACKUP_BACKEND=blue-app swarm_nginx
```

## Finished 🔚

Execute the bash script `deploy.sh` again. 

Specify option `3`.

This will destroy everything Terraform created and clean up your dev environment.

🚨 *I always like deactivating or deleting AWS programmatic access keys when I'm finished!*
